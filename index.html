          Hi, I'm David Ma, an aspiring coder. Welcome to my Portfolio! <br />
          <br />
          I was born in Beijing, China. My last name Ma (simplified Chinese:
          <strong>马</strong>; traditional Chinese: <strong>馬</strong>; pinyin:
          Mǎ) means horse in English, which is why the favicon of this portfolio
          site is a horse. <br />
          <br />
          At the age of 6, I moved to the US to Cleveland, Ohio, which is where
          I grew up. I am 2 years younger than Lebron James who is also from the
          Cleveland area, and was a big fan of Lebron until he left for the
          Miami Heat during the "Decision", but begrudgingly welcomed him back
          to Cleveland and was ultimately happy that the Cavs won their first
          championship. <br />
          <br />
          I moved to NYC when I was 18 for college, where I got my Bachelors of
          Science in Operations Research with a Minor in Economics at Columbia
          University. Since graduating I've worked in various positions across
          finance at the New York Stock Exchange, in technology at a startup
          Openfolio, and most recentely in insurance at Marsh. I have a
          confession - I flunked my very first Intro to Computer Science class
          at Columbia, and my effort with this Bootcamp is to rectify that. I am
          planning on using my newly learned skills to create a website for my
          upcoming Children's Book, The Emperor's Seed. More Importantly, I am
          hoping this class will serve as a foundation for learning coding in
          general including new languages, thought processes, and skills that
          can be useful for a lifetime. <br />
          <br />
          Thank you for visiting. This is the first working webpage that I wrote
          from scratch. I hope you enjoyed your visit!
